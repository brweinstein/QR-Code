### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This was my first html and css project. I learned the basics of html structure and css. I was very proud of figuring out how to use Flexbox to center the image and div. I look a while to figure out how to create the white rounded background.

```css
body {
   background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
   display: flex;
   justify-content: center;
   align-items: center;
   height: 100vh;
}
```
